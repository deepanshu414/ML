## 🌟 Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating systems that can learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It's the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/deepansu414/ML.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the notebooks in the `tutorials` directory.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

Machine Learning encompasses several key concepts:

- **Supervised Learning**: The algorithm learns from labeled training data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The algorithm learns through interaction with an environment.
- **Feature Engineering**: The process of creating meaningful features from raw data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to assess the performance of ML models.

## 🔬 Algorithms

This repository covers a wide range of ML algorithms, including:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Means Clustering
7. Neural Networks
8. Deep Learning architectures

Each algorithm is explained in detail in its respective notebook in the `algorithms` directory.

Example:

```python
from src.models import LinearRegression

# Create and train a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
